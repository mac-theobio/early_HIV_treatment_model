We are currently considering a model with: Susceptible, Infectious, Treated and LTFU.

\begin{itemize}
 \item For class I, we would keep track of time since infection $\tau_i$.
 \item For class T, we would keep track of time on treatment $\tau_T$, time reset to zero.
 \item For class L, we would keep track of $\tau_L$, also here time resets.
\end{itemize}

We assume that death rate depends on:

\begin{itemize}
 \item time since infection for class I.
 \item only natural death for class T.
 \item time since LTFU for class L. 
\end{itemize}

We assume that transmission potential depends on:

\begin{itemize}
 \item time since infection for class I.
 \item for class T - does not depend on time since treatment. We consider average transmission probability of individuals who are not ART and then multiply that by a coefficient for the reduction effect due to HIV treatment. 
 \item time since LTFU for class L, but multiplied by a scaling parameter to account for a behavior change which we might see. If we assume the scaling parameter as 1 (equal infectiousness level), then it means an individual in L class who has been one year since LTFU is as infectious as an individual in I class who has been infected for one year.
\end{itemize}
 
 ART initiation depends on:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item time since infection, calendar time and ART access rate for class I.
  \item time since LTFU, calendar time and ART access rate for class L.
 \end{itemize}

 The rate of LTFU depends on time since treatment. \\ 
 
 Issues or decisions we might face:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item rate of ART re-initiation for class L.
  \item relative infectiousness level of class L as compared to I. Or just the infection rate due to class L.
  \item parameterization of dropout rate as a function of time since treatment.
  \item parameterization of HIV/AIDS induced death rate for classes T and L.
 \end{itemize}

 Note: If we assume that treated individuals are forced to stay on HIV treatment (no second-line) or dropout from ART, we won't have delays from implicit treatment failure. Losing the history of infection and treatment for class L is a limitation, but difficult to track both.
